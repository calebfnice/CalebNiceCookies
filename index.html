<h1>Monster Cookies</h1>

<p> Studded with colored <a href="https://www.mms.com/en-us/">candies</a> (delicious if they are peanut-filled, too), these treats are an amazing way to end a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/dinner-vs-supper-difference-history-meaning">grown-up supper</a>, and a very useful way to keep a roomful of boisterous children happy. </p>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<h4>Step 1:</h4>
 <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and rolled oats. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer combine butter, light brown sugar and superfine sugar. Beat until creamy. Add egg and vanilla, and beat again until smooth.</p>
<h4>Step 2:</h4>
<p>Add flour mixture to butter mixture, and beat until smooth. By hand, fold in chopped pecans and M&M's.</p>
<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<p>Roll quarter-cup measures of dough into balls and flatten them into fat disks (about ½ inch thick). Place on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet, about 6 at a time, so they have room to spread.</p>
<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<p> Bake until cookies are risen, dry on surface and very lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. They will be too soft to lift from baking sheet. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.</p>
